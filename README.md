## Below is a short description:

### What was your motivation?

      I wanted to create a platform where users could easily share their thoughts and connect with friends. I was particularly interested in learning how to leverage a NoSQL database like MongoDB to manage the data.

### Why did you build this project?

      This project is a practical application of concepts learned in the course, providing a valuable learning experience in building APIs, working with databases, and handling real-world data interactions.

### What problem does it solve?

      This API addresses the need for a simple yet effective way to create and manage a social network, allowing users to share thoughts, react to posts, and maintain a friend list.

### What did you learn?

![Insomnia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Insomnia-4000BF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Insomnia&logoColor=white)

      This project solidified my understanding of MongoDB, Express.js, JavaScript, and RESTful API design. I also gained experience in testing APIs using Insomnia and managing data with MongoDB Compass.
